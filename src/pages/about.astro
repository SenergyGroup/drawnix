		Hi, I’m the creator behind Drawnix, a YouTube channel and website dedicated to showing what it 
		really looks like to build a digital business from the ground up starting at $0. I document every step of the 
		journey, sharing what I build, how I build it, what works, what doesn’t, and how AI helps me along the 
		way. This channel is about being transparent, practical, and real about the process of starting from 0.

		To support the community, I offer free tools and resources to help you choose the right path for you. 
		These include tools like flowcharts, prioritization tools to spend your time wisely, and other templates 
		and frameworks mentioned in my videos. These are designed to be practical and flexible. They are meant to 
		help you make your own decisions, not to follow a rigid checklist. By signing up with your 
		email, you’ll get access to these resources, and you’ll also stay connected through a monthly newsletter. 
		The newsletter keeps you updated on my journey, including how much I’ve earned so far, the latest videos 
		and insights, and a spotlight on tools or products I personally use and recommend.
	</p>

	<p>
		The heart of Drawnix is building in public. Every piece of content is tied back to that mission. I aim
		to show the process, the tools, and the mindset behind building something from nothing. Whether you’re 
		here to grab a tool, watch the videos, or just get inspired, I hope you leave with something useful and 
		maybe even a little motivation to start your own journey too.
