Building a successful digital business is harder than the gurus make it sound. For five years, I chased the dream of creating something online, only to face minimal success and frustrating dead ends. I tried everything from freelancing to consulting, but couldn't find a sustainable path forward.
This journey isn't about pretending to have all the answers. It's about a real, transparent attempt to build a digital company from the ground up, with a public goal of reaching $50,000 in revenue. I’m documenting every step—the strategies, the costs, the failures, and the wins—so you can learn alongside me.

## Why Most Digital Businesses Fail (And How to Avoid It)
The digital landscape is crowded. Every niche is filled with established players. The key to breaking through isn't just working harder; it's working smarter by finding your unique angle. Your "spin" is the one thing that sets you apart from the competition. It’s what you can offer that no one else can, rooted in your genuine skills and passion.
The biggest mistake I made was trying to be someone I wasn't. The most crucial question to ask yourself before you start is:
“What am I so passionate about that I would do it for months, or even years, without getting paid?”
Your answer to that question is where your most powerful business ideas are hiding.

## Find Your Path: What's Your Digital Archetype?
Feeling stuck? You're not alone. It's easy to get lost in a sea of conflicting advice about market research, branding, and product creation. To cut through the noise, you need a starting point that aligns with your natural strengths.
That's why I created the Digital Archetype Quiz.
This isn't another generic personality test. It’s a free, simple tool designed to help you identify your core approach to business. Are you a natural Builder who loves creating products? A Teacher who excels at explaining complex topics? Or an Influencer who thrives on building a community?
Knowing your archetype gives you a clear direction and helps you choose business models and marketing strategies that you'll actually enjoy and stick with.
